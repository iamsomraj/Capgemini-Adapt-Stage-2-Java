Create an interface named Shape in file with the following abstract methods



getArea() : double ( return type is double)
getPerimeter() : double
Create an abstract class named AbstractShape which implements
 Shape interface with the below private instance variable



colour:String
create parameterized constructor
Override toString() method to return 
String as per below format
colour=X
where X represents value of colour variable

Create a concrete subclass of AbstractShape
 named Rectangle with the below private instance variables





length:int
breadth:int
create constructor with 3 parameters to initialize colour, 
length and breadth properties of Rectangle in the given sequence
implement the inherited methods getArea and getPerimeter 
using appropriate formulas for Rectangle[Refer Hints Section]
Override toString to return String as per below format
Rectangle [colour=X, length=X, breadth=X]
where X represent respective values of variables

Create another concrete subclass of AbstractShape 
named Circle with the below private instance variable



radius:int
create constructor with 2 parameters to initialize colour 
and radius properties of Circle in the given sequence
implement the inherited methods getArea and getPerimeter 
using appropriate formulas for Circle[Refer Hints Section]
Override toString to return String as per below format
Circle [colour=X, radius=X]
where X represent respective values of variables

In the class Source, do the following

Create a static method named printShape which should 
 able to take any shape object as parameter. This method
  should display the area and perimeter of the input 
  shape object in the below format.



Area: X,Perimeter: X
where X represent the respective values.cThe area and
 perimeter should be rounded to the nearest integer and 
 displayed

In the main method, do the following



Accept first input as CIRCLE or RECTANGLE.
If first input is CIRCLE, Accept colour and 
radius
If first input is RECTANGLE, Accept colour, 
length and breadth
Create object of Circle or Rectangle based on 
first input and print the details of object.
Call printShape to print the Area and Perimeter.
Note: Use Console to accept input

Refer Example section for Input and output format



Example
Sample Input:
CIRCLE
RED 5

Expected Output:
Circle [colour=RED, radius=5]
Area: 79,Perimeter: 31
Sample Input:
RECTANGLE
GREEN 10 5

Expected Output:
Rectangle [colour=GREEN, length=10, breadth=5]
Area: 50,Perimeter: 30
Hints/Tips
Circle Formulas
Area 		: Pi x r x r
Perimeter	: 2 x Pi x r
Rectangle Formulas
Area 		: l x b
Perimeter 	: 2 x (l+b)
Use static variable PI of Math class
Use Math.round(..) for rounding a double
 to nearest integer. Rounding should be 
 done in printShape method
Instructions
Do not change the provided class/method 
names unless instructed
Ensure your code compiles without 
any errors/warning/deprecations
Follow best practices while coding
Avoid too many & unnecessary usage 
of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...),

 places in your exercise, to explain the logic,
 rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them
Try to retain the original code given 
 the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach
Warnings
Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
Trim the output and avoid special characters
Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output
EXECUTION TIME LIMIT
Default.
