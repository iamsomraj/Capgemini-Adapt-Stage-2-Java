Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them
Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach
Testing


//Parameterized Constructor
Customer c1 = new Customer(1, "Vinod", "Bangalore", null, null);
Customer c2 = new Customer(1, "Vinod", "Bangalore", null, null);

//Equals
c1.equals(c2) --> should return true
c2.equals(c1) --> should return true

//Setter and Equals
c1.setEmail("vinod@mailinator.com");
c1.equals(c2) --> should return false
c2.equals(c1) --> should return false

c2.setEmail("vinod@mailinator.com");
c1.equals(c2) --> should return true
c2.equals(c1) --> should return true

//Default Constructor
Customer c3 = new Customer();
Customer c4 = new Customer();
c3.equals(c4) --> should return true
