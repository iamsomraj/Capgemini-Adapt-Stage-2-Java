Complete the main method of the class Source with appropriate code to accept all the 3 sides of a triangle and display if the triangle is a right angle triangle or not.

A rigt angle triangle is a triangle whose sum of squares of two sides will result in the square of the third side.

Following requirements should be taken care in the program.



Input should be taken through Console
Program should print the output as described in the Example Section below
The input values representing sides of the triangle must be accepted in the decreasing order of their length.
Take sides as integers.
Example
Sample Input 1:
5 4 3 
Expected Output:
RIGHT ANGLE 
Sample Input 2:
7 6 5 
Expected Output:
NOT RIGHT ANGLE 
Sample Input 3:
13 12 5
Expected Output:
RIGHT ANGLE
Sample Input 4:
4 6 8
Expected Output:
INVALID_INPUT
