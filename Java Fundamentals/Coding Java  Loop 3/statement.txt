Complete the main method to find whether a given 3-digit number is an Armstrong number or not.

An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 33 + 73 + 13 = 371.

Input should be taken through Console
Program should print the output as described in the Example Section below
If the number is not 3 digit output should show as INVALID_INPUT
